## MazePath Visualizer

![](PathF.gif)

This web application helps you visualize 5 different pathfinding algorithms and 5 maze generation algorithms. You can choose one algorithm at a time or multiple algorithms simultaneously. Up to four grids will be available, and in each grid, you can assign a maze generation algorithm and a pathfinding algorithm.

## ✨ Salient Features

1. **🧑‍🏫 Interactive Tutorial for First-Time Users**  
   A built-in personalized walkthrough guides new users through the interface, explaining how to choose algorithms, generate mazes, and interpret visualizations.

2. **🖥️ Four Simultaneous Visualizations**  
   The interface supports four independent grids side by side. Each grid allows the user to select a unique combination of maze generation and pathfinding algorithms to compare their behavior in real-time.

3. **🧭 Clear & Informative Legend**  
   A dynamic legend explains each visual component:

   - Unvisited nodes
   - Visited nodes
   - Walls
   - Start and end points
   - Current node
   - Weighted nodes
   - Shortest path nodes

4. **⏱️ Adjustable Animation Speeds**  
   Maze generation and pathfinding animations can be slowed down or sped up using a slider for a better understanding of algorithm behavior.

5. **➕ Support for Weights & Diagonal Movement**  
   Users can manually assign weighted cells to simulate varieties. Optionally, diagonal steps can be enabled to explore 8-directional pathfinding.

## 🚀 Future Improvements

1. **⏹️ Pause / Stop Button**  
   A dedicated control to pause or stop ongoing animations for better user control and analysis.

2. **📐 Customizable Grid Size**  
   Allow users to define grid dimensions dynamically to simulate larger or more compact pathfinding scenarios.

3. **📊 Additional Algorithms**  
   Introduction of more advanced pathfinding algorithms, such as:
   - Bellman-Ford
   - Floyd-Warshall
   - Bidirectional BFS
